// Same as in Java. Depending on whether the string is first or appearing later, the
// operation works differently

alert(2 + 2 + "1"); // 41, not 221
alert("1" + 2 + 2) // 122, not 14

// The binary + is the ONLY operator that supports strings in such a way.
// Other arithmetic operators work only with numbers and always convert their operands to numbers.

alert(6 + "2") // 62
alert( 6 - "2"); // 4, converts "2" to a number

alert("6" / "2") // 3, converts both operands to numbers

/*  The plus + exists in two forms:
    the binary form that we used above and the unary form.

    The unary plus or, in other words,
    the plus operator + applied to a single value,
    doesnâ€™t do anything to numbers.

    But if the operand is not a number,
    the unary plus converts it into a number.*/

let apples = "2";
let bananas = "3";

// Modify-in-place like += -= *= /= like Java

// Comma operator
